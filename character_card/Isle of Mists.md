## Weapons & Magic
### Weapons
Each character has an assigned weapon weight based on their class.
The weight determines base damage, accuracy, and speed of attack.

Light weapons can be dual-wielded when possible while Heavy weapons cannot. Even though some Heavy weapons only require 1 hand for operation, their martial arts require more focus and strength and must be used alone. 

**Light**
* blade
* staff / light spear
* blunt
* ranged
**Heavy**
* blade
* heavy spear / pole-arm 
* blunt
* ranged

**Blade**
- light
	- short sword
	- dagger
	- knife
- heavy
	- broad sword
	- katana
	- zweihander

**Staff / Light Spear**
The staff can only be used by those with the Light weapon skill.
It is an agile weapon of about 4 or 6 feet in length and made of a solid but light material (usually bamboo wood). The wielder would perform elaborate movements with their staff to confuse their opponent before landing a blow from above or the side of their opponent. The staff is generally very effective against cloth and leather armor but loses all efficacy against mail armor. A light spear may be used by those with the Light weapon skill and although slower in use, it can penetrate mail armor. The light spear does not have a blade, but rather a metal end that is tapered to a pinpoint to maximize the penetrating power of each thrust.

**Heavy Spear / Pole-Arm**
The heavy spear can be wielded by those with the Heavy weapon skill.
Averaging around 5 to 6 feet in length and with a thick shaft of heavy wood or metal, the heavy spear is meant for sharp, calculated thrusts and heavy controlling sweep motions which keep enemies at bay with the razor sharp blade along ether side of the the spearâ€™s point. The pole-arm is very similar to the heavy spear but has an axe blade on one side. This weapon can be used for crowd control against weaker enemies or even as an offense/defensive combo against heavily armed enemies with mail armor.

### Magic
Magic abilities must be cast from the off-hand by any character unless they are a Magus character type. Magi can cast spells from either hand but battle magic is limited to their primary hand while support spells can only be cast from the off-hand as with other character types. Naturally, some spells require 2 hands for operation and will automatically un-equip any spell held in the off-hand.
